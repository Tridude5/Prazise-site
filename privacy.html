        <p class="muted"><em>Last updated: <span id="last-updated"></span></em></p>
        <p>Prazise (“<strong>Prazise</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what we collect on this website and through our forms today, how we use it, and your choices. It also describes what will change when the Prazise app launches.</p>

        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Plain-English summary.</strong> We don’t run ads, we don’t sell personal data, and we aim to collect the minimum necessary to provide the service. Today, that’s mostly your email when you join the waitlist or contact us.

      <section>
        <h2>Who we are & contact</h2>
        <p>Prazise is currently operated by a small team. For any privacy questions or requests, email <a href="mailto:slavinskasjack@gmail.com">slavinskasjack@gmail.com</a>. You can optionally cc <a href="mailto:johnslavinskas@my.uopeople.edu">johnslavinskas@my.uopeople.edu</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Website hosting logs.</strong> Our site is hosted on GitHub Pages (with a global CDN). Standard server logs (e.g., IP address, user-agent, pages requested) may be created by the hosting/CDN for security and reliability. We don’t run tracking cookies and we don’t do cross-site tracking.</li>
          <li><strong>Waitlist form.</strong> If you opt in, we collect your email address and (optionally) the device you’re interested in (e.g., Garmin, Apple Health). The form is delivered to our inbox via a third-party form relay (see “Processors”).</li>
          <li><strong>Contact form.</strong> If you contact us, we collect the information you submit (name, email, topic, message) so we can reply.</li>
          <li><strong>Future app data (when launched, with your consent).</strong> If you connect services like Apple Health, Google Fit, Garmin, Polar, Suunto, etc., we may process training and wellness metrics you explicitly authorize us to access. Integration availability depends on provider terms and your consent.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why we use data (purposes)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and improve the website and upcoming app.</li>
          <li>Operate the waitlist, send early-access invitations, and understand device interest.</li>
          <li>Respond to questions and support requests.</li>
          <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>do not sell</strong> personal data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Legal bases (where applicable)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consent</strong> — waitlist emails, optional device interest, and any health/fitness data you later connect in the app.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — site operation, security, abuse prevention, responding to inquiries.</li>
          <li><strong>Contract</strong> — to deliver features you sign up for and support requests you initiate.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — to comply with applicable laws and enforce our terms.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing & processors</h2>
        <p>We share personal data only with service providers (“processors”) that help us run Prazise, under appropriate protections:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li><strong>Website hosting/CDN:</strong> GitHub Pages (GitHub) and its CDN deliver this site and may generate standard logs.</li>
          <li><strong>Form relay (waitlist & contact):</strong> FormSubmit — securely forwards form submissions to our email. The content you submit is processed by them to deliver the message.</li>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong> We receive submissions in our Gmail inbox. Your message (and our reply) is retained in email like any standard correspondence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We don’t share data with advertisers or data brokers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Waitlist:</strong> kept until you ask us to remove it or until the waitlist phase ends, after which we’ll either invite you, ask if you want to stay, or delete the record.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact messages:</strong> kept as long as needed to resolve your inquiry and for reasonable record-keeping.</li>
          <li><strong>Hosting logs:</strong> retained by the hosting/CDN per their policies; we don’t control those durations.</li>
          <li><strong>App data (future):</strong> retained while your account is active and deleted upon request or account closure, subject to any legal holds.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your choices & rights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Opt-out of the waitlist or marketing:</strong> email us from the subscribed address and we’ll remove you.</li>
          <li><strong>Access, correction, deletion:</strong> email us to request a copy, correction, or deletion of your data.</li>
          <li><strong>EU/UK residents:</strong> you may also have rights to restrict or object to processing and data portability. You can lodge a complaint with your data protection authority.</li>
          <li><strong>California residents:</strong> you may have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including access, deletion, and non-discrimination. We do not sell or share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to the data we handle (e.g., HTTPS, limited access, vendor due diligence). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; if we learn of a breach affecting you, we’ll notify you and/or regulators as required.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>International transfers</h2>
        <p>Our processors (e.g., hosting, email, form relay) may process data in the United States and other countries. By contacting us or joining the waitlist, you understand your data may be transferred outside your region, under appropriate safeguards.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>Prazise isn’t directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided us personal data, contact us and we’ll delete it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy as we launch new features or as laws change. We’ll update the “Last updated” date above and, when appropriate, provide additional notice.</p>
